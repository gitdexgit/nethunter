# This script finds predefined windows by title or class and arranges them
# into a fixed layout. This is intended to be bound to a single hotkey.

# --- Main Execution Logic ---

# 1. Arrange main windows by title prefix (and make them sticky)
# for prefix in "_a_" "_f_" "_l_" "_j_"; do
#     arrange_by_title "$prefix" "$GEOMETRY_MAIN" "yes"
# done

# 2. Arrange main applications by class (and make them sticky)
# arrange_by_class "sublime_text.Sublime_text" "$GEOMETRY_MAIN"
arrange_by_class "copyq.copyq" "0,1921,160,1364,764"

# for some reaosn keepassxc cannot be moved
# arrange_by_class "KeePassXC" "0,1200,205,1364,732"

# 3. Arrange medium and mini windows (and make them sticky)
# arrange_by_title "_m_" "0,1922,541,1363,412" "yes"
# arrange_by_title "_mi_" "$GEOMETRY_MINI" "yes"
# arrange_by_title "_tmux_" "$GEOMETRY_MAIN" "yes"

# 4. Arrange "DesktopSwitch Settings" (and DO NOT make it sticky)
arrange_by_title "Recent - Thunar" "0,1920,159,1364,764" "yes"
# arrange_by_title "Virtual Machine Manager" "0,2606,220,678,731" "yes"
# for some reaosn keepassxc cannot be moved
# arrange_by_title "KeePassXC" "0,2606,220,678,731" "yes"
# arrange_by_title "DesktopSwitch Settings" "0,1921,-313,279,1310" "yes"
# arrange_by_title "Artha" "0,1922,220,732,730" "yes"
